# Contextualized Note-Taking with NotebookLM

This document provides an example of how NotebookLM can facilitate contextualized note-taking by creating structured notes based on the article "Agriculture and climate change - Agriculture Victoria" by the Department of Jobs, P. and R. (2021).

## Example Document

For this test, I used an article titled "Agriculture and climate change - Agriculture Victoria." by Department of Jobs, P. and R. (2021, May 2) https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/climate-and-weather/policy-programs-action ‌
For this demonstration, the article outlines the Victorian Government's strategy for addressing climate change in the agricultural sector, with an emphasis on achieving resilience and net-zero emissions by 2050.
