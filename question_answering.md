# Question Answering with NotebookLM

This repository provides examples of interactive question generation and answering based on summaries of structured content. 

## Example Document 
For this test, I used an article titled "Agriculture and climate change - Agriculture Victoria." by Department of Jobs, P. and R. (2021, May 2) https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/climate-and-weather/policy-programs-action ‌

The Victorian Government's strategy addresses climate change in agriculture, aiming for resilience and net-zero emissions by 2050. Below are generated questions and concise answers based on a summary of their approach.

## Generated Questions and Answers

### 1. What are the primary climate challenges facing agriculture in Victoria?

  The sources highlight a range of climate challenges that pose significant threats to agriculture in Victoria. 
  *   **Increased temperatures and reduced rainfall:** The sources indicate that Victoria's climate is becoming warmer and drier, which presents a major challenge for agricultural practices. This shift in climate patterns can lead to water scarcity, impacting crop yields and livestock production. 
  *   **Extreme weather events:**  The sources emphasize the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, storms, bushfires, droughts, and floods. These events can cause widespread damage to crops and infrastructure, disrupt farming operations, and lead to significant economic losses.
  *   **Climate change adaptation:**  The sources acknowledge that adapting to these changing climate conditions is crucial for the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. This includes adopting new farming practices, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, and developing strategies to manage climate risks.
  *   **Transformative changes:** The sources suggest that transformative changes in agricultural practices may be necessary to ensure long-term adaptation to climate change. This could involve shifting to different crops or livestock breeds better suited to the changing climate, adopting new technologies, and exploring innovative approaches to farming.
  
  The sources emphasize the urgency of addressing these climate challenges to ensure the future sustainability and productivity of agriculture in Victoria. They underscore the importance of collaboration between government, industry, and farmers to mitigate climate risks, adapt to changing conditions, and build a more resilient agricultural sector. 


### 2. What are the Victorian Government's emission reduction targets for 2025 and 2030?

  The Victorian Government's Climate Change Strategy 2021–2030 establishes clear emission reduction targets for 2025 and 2030. These targets are defined as a percentage reduction compared to the baseline emissions levels in 2005:
  *   **For 2025, the government aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 28–33% compared to 2005 levels.**
  *   **By 2030, the target is to achieve a reduction of 45–50% compared to 2005 emissions.** <br />
  
  These targets demonstrate the Victorian Government's commitment to significantly curbing emissions over the coming years. While the provided sources do not detail the specific policies and measures that will be implemented to reach these goals, the strategy likely involves a multifaceted approach encompassing various sectors, including energy, transportation, industry, and agriculture. <br /> 
  The sources primarily focus on the agricultural sector's contribution to emissions and the government's efforts to support farmers in reducing their environmental impact. The Agriculture Sector Pledge, for instance, outlines a range of initiatives aimed at reducing emissions from agricultural activities while maintaining productivity. <br /> 
  However, it's important to note that achieving the overall emission reduction targets will require coordinated efforts across all sectors of the economy.  The Climate Change Strategy 2021–2030 likely provides a comprehensive roadmap for these efforts, detailing sector-specific plans and initiatives to drive down emissions and transition Victoria towards a net-zero emissions future by 2050. <br />


### 3. How does the government support farmers in reducing emissions?

  The sources provided do not contain information about how governments support farmers in reducing emissions. The study focuses on the impact of climate change on global agriculture, particularly examining the effects on water availability, crop production, and economic welfare. The study analyzes how climate change affects farmers but does not explore government policies aimed at supporting farmers in reducing emissions.
