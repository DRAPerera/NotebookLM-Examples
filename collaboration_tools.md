## Introduction
Collaborative learning enables students to work together to enhance understanding and knowledge retention. NotebookLM provides tools that support collaboration by allowing multiple users to share notes, resources, and insights in real-time.

## Process
1. **Project Setup**:
   - Created a shared workspace within NotebookLM for the group project on "Agriculture and Climate Change."
   - Invited team members to join the workspace.

2. **Resource Upload**:
   - Uploaded key documents, including the article "Agriculture and Climate Change - Agriculture Victoria" and relevant research papers.
   - Each team member was tasked with summarizing sections of the document and adding their insights.

3. **Note-Taking and Collaboration**:
   - Used NotebookLM's collaborative features to take notes in real-time during discussions.
   - Members tagged important concepts and linked related resources.
   - Established a tagging system to categorize notes (e.g., "Policy", "Emissions", "Adaptation").

4. **Review and Feedback**:
   - After initial note-taking, the group reviewed each other's contributions and provided feedback directly within NotebookLM.
   - Discussed and revised notes based on group consensus.

5. **Finalizing Notes**:
   - Compiled the organized notes into a structured document for submission, ensuring all sections were coherent and informative.

## Results
- The collaborative efforts led to a comprehensive set of structured notes that included key themes and resources related to climate change and agriculture.
