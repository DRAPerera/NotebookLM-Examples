This working paper, Climate Change Impacts on Global Agriculture, uses a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, GTAP-W, that distinguishes between rainfed and irrigated agriculture, to assess the potential impacts of climate change and CO2 fertilization on global agriculture.
*The authors use predicted changes in precipitation, temperature, and river flow under the IPCC SRES A1B and A2 scenarios from previous studies.
*They contrast a relatively optimistic scenario (A1B) with a relatively pessimistic scenario (A2) to cover some of the uncertainty of future climate change impacts on water availability.
*The analysis is carried out at two time periods: the 2020s (medium-term) and 2050s (long-term).

Results of the Study
*Global food production, welfare, and GDP fall in the two time periods and SRES scenarios, and higher food prices are expected.
*Expected losses in welfare are marked in the long term. They are larger under the SRES A2 scenario for the 2020s and under the SRES A1B scenario for the 2050s.
*The authors find that countries are not only influenced by regional climate change, but also by climate-induced changes in competitiveness.
*Climate change is expected to reduce welfare in a higher number of developing regions, although both developed and developing regions are expected to face welfare losses.

The study has several limitations, including the fact that it uses regional averages for precipitation, temperature, and river flow, and does not consider differences between river basins within the same region. The study also uses annual average data and does not consider changes in seasonality or extreme events. Additionally, the study does not address uncertainty in its scenarios, other than by the use of two emission scenarios from only one climate model. Finally, the study does not consider any cost or investment associated with the expansion of irrigated areas, which may overestimate the benefits of some scenarios.
